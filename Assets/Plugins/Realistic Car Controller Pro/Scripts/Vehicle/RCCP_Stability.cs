/// - ABS (Anti-skid Braking System),

/// - TCS (Traction Control System),
/// plus steering, traction, and angular-drag helpers.
///
/// Steering reference for ESP:
/// ESP V2 uses <c>FrontAxle.steerAngle</c> as its reference steer angle — the vehicle-commanded
/// wheel angle after RCCP_Input processing (steering curve, counter-steer, steering limiter).
/// This is the actual state the wheels are in, so the bicycle-model reference yaw reflects what
/// the vehicle is commanding rather than what the player requested. Using player-side intent here
/// would over-estimate target yaw at high speeds where the steering curve attenuates, causing
/// false understeer classification.
///
/// Player vs vehicle input split:
/// CarController exposes both <c>steerInput_P</c> (player-processed) and <c>steerInput_V</c>
/// (vehicle-realized, averaged from axle.steerAngle / maxSteerAngle) as semantically distinct
/// signals after the VehicleInputs() rewire. ESP reads the authoritative per-axle state directly.
/// The AngularDragHelper branch that compares |steerInput_V| against |steerInput_P| is
/// load-bearing — it detects wheel-vs-request slew lag and counter-steer contributions.
