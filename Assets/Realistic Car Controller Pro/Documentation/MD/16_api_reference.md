# API Reference

This document covers every public method in the `RCCP` static class and every event in `RCCP_Events`. These are the two primary entry points you will use when integrating Realistic Car Controller Pro into your own game scripts.

---

## Overview

`RCCP` is a **static utility class**. You do not need to create an instance or attach it to a GameObject. Call any method directly:

```csharp
RCCP.MethodName();
```

Every script that calls the RCCP API should include the following at the top:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
```

No additional `using` statements are required because RCCP uses the global namespace.

**Key points:**

- All methods are `public static` -- call them from any MonoBehaviour.
- Methods that target a specific vehicle take an `RCCP_CarController` parameter.
- Methods that target the current player vehicle operate through `RCCP_SceneManager.Instance`.
- Vehicle prefabs must have an `RCCP_CarController` component to work with this API.

---

## Vehicle Spawning and Registration

These methods handle instantiating vehicle prefabs at runtime and telling the system which vehicle the player is currently driving.

### SpawnRCC

Instantiates a vehicle prefab, activates it, and optionally registers it as the player vehicle.

```csharp
public static RCCP_CarController SpawnRCC(
    RCCP_CarController vehiclePrefab,
    Vector3 position,
    Quaternion rotation,
    bool registerAsPlayerVehicle,
    bool isControllable,
    bool isEngineRunning
)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehiclePrefab` | `RCCP_CarController` | The vehicle prefab to instantiate. Must have an RCCP_CarController component. |
| `position` | `Vector3` | World position where the vehicle will spawn. |
| `rotation` | `Quaternion` | World rotation applied to the spawned vehicle. |
| `registerAsPlayerVehicle` | `bool` | If `true`, the spawned vehicle becomes the active player vehicle immediately. |
| `isControllable` | `bool` | If `true`, the player can control this vehicle right away. |
| `isEngineRunning` | `bool` | If `true`, the engine starts running immediately. If `false`, the engine is killed. |

**Returns:** The spawned `RCCP_CarController` instance.

```csharp
// Spawn a car at the origin, register as player, controllable, engine on
public RCCP_CarController carPrefab;

void Start() {
    RCCP_CarController spawnedCar = RCCP.SpawnRCC(
        carPrefab,
        Vector3.zero,
        Quaternion.identity,
        true,   // register as player vehicle
        true,   // player can control it
        true    // engine starts running
    );
}
```

### RegisterPlayerVehicle

Registers an existing vehicle as the active player vehicle. The RCCP camera and UI will follow this vehicle. There are three overloads.

**Overload 1 -- Vehicle only:**

```csharp
public static void RegisterPlayerVehicle(RCCP_CarController vehicle)
```

Registers the vehicle with its current controllable and engine states unchanged.

```csharp
// Register an already-spawned vehicle as the player vehicle
RCCP.RegisterPlayerVehicle(myVehicle);
```

**Overload 2 -- Vehicle with controllable state:**

```csharp
public static void RegisterPlayerVehicle(RCCP_CarController vehicle, bool isControllable)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | The vehicle to register. |
| `isControllable` | `bool` | If `true`, enables player control. If `false`, disables it. |

```csharp
// Register vehicle and enable player control
RCCP.RegisterPlayerVehicle(myVehicle, true);
```

**Overload 3 -- Vehicle with controllable and engine state:**

```csharp
public static void RegisterPlayerVehicle(RCCP_CarController vehicle, bool isControllable, bool engineState)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | The vehicle to register. |
| `isControllable` | `bool` | If `true`, enables player control. |
| `engineState` | `bool` | If `true`, starts the engine. If `false`, kills it. |

```csharp
// Register vehicle, enable control, and start the engine
RCCP.RegisterPlayerVehicle(myVehicle, true, true);
```

### DeRegisterPlayerVehicle

Removes the current player vehicle registration. The camera and UI will no longer follow any vehicle.

```csharp
public static void DeRegisterPlayerVehicle()
```

Takes no parameters.

```csharp
// Player exits the car -- deregister so camera stops following
RCCP.DeRegisterPlayerVehicle();
```

---

## Vehicle Control

These methods control whether a vehicle accepts player input and whether its engine is running.

### SetControl

Enables or disables player control of a vehicle. When disabled, player inputs are zeroed and brakes are applied automatically.

```csharp
public static void SetControl(RCCP_CarController vehicle, bool isControllable)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | Target vehicle. |
| `isControllable` | `bool` | `true` to enable player input, `false` to disable it. |

```csharp
// Disable player control during a cutscene
RCCP.SetControl(playerCar, false);

// Re-enable after the cutscene
RCCP.SetControl(playerCar, true);
```

### SetExternalControl

Marks a vehicle as being driven by an external controller (AI, network, replay). When `true`, the vehicle's input component ignores the player input manager and instead uses override inputs.

```csharp
public static void SetExternalControl(RCCP_CarController vehicle, bool isExternal)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | Target vehicle. |
| `isExternal` | `bool` | `true` to mark as externally controlled, `false` to return to player control. |

```csharp
// Hand control to an AI driver
RCCP.SetExternalControl(aiCar, true);

// Return to player control
RCCP.SetExternalControl(aiCar, false);
```

**Note:** This method performs a null check. If `vehicle` is null, it returns silently.

### SetEngine

Starts or stops the vehicle engine.

```csharp
public static void SetEngine(RCCP_CarController vehicle, bool engineState)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | Target vehicle. |
| `engineState` | `bool` | `true` to start the engine, `false` to kill it. |

```csharp
// Start the engine
RCCP.SetEngine(playerCar, true);

// Kill the engine (e.g., player parked the car)
RCCP.SetEngine(playerCar, false);
```

### SetAutomaticGear

Sets the vehicle's transmission type. There are two overloads.

**Overload 1 -- Boolean (Automatic or Manual):**

```csharp
public static void SetAutomaticGear(RCCP_CarController vehicle, bool state)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | Target vehicle. |
| `state` | `bool` | `true` = Automatic, `false` = Manual. |

```csharp
// Switch to automatic transmission
RCCP.SetAutomaticGear(playerCar, true);
```

**Overload 2 -- TransmissionType enum:**

```csharp
public static void SetAutomaticGear(RCCP_CarController vehicle, RCCP_Gearbox.TransmissionType transmissionType)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | Target vehicle. |
| `transmissionType` | `RCCP_Gearbox.TransmissionType` | One of: `Manual`, `Automatic`, `Automatic_DNRP`. |

The `Automatic_DNRP` option adds a Drive/Neutral/Reverse/Park selector, similar to real automatic cars.

```csharp
// Switch to DNRP automatic mode
RCCP.SetAutomaticGear(playerCar, RCCP_Gearbox.TransmissionType.Automatic_DNRP);
```

**Note:** Both overloads check whether the vehicle has a Gearbox component. If it does not, the call is ignored.

---

## Driver Assists (V2.55+)

Opt-in convenience assists. All default off and change nothing until enabled, so existing prefabs and behavior are unaffected.

### SetHillStartAssist

Enables or disables hill-start assist. While enabled, the vehicle automatically holds full brake when stopped on a slope (forward gears only) until the driver applies throttle, preventing roll-back on hills.

```csharp
public static void SetHillStartAssist(RCCP_CarController vehicle, bool state)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | Target vehicle. |
| `state` | `bool` | `true` = enable hill-start assist, `false` = disable. |

```csharp
// Enable hill-start assist on the player car
RCCP.SetHillStartAssist(playerCar, true);
```

Tuning fields live on `RCCP_Input`: `hillStartMinSlope` (degrees), `hillStartSpeedThreshold` (km/h), and `hillStartReleaseThrottle`.

### SetCruiseControl

Engages or disengages cruise control. While engaged, throttle is injected to hold a target speed (forward gears only, paused while shifting); any driver brake input cancels it. Two overloads.

**Overload 1 -- keep the current target speed:**

```csharp
public static void SetCruiseControl(RCCP_CarController vehicle, bool state)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | Target vehicle. |
| `state` | `bool` | `true` = engage, `false` = disengage. |

**Overload 2 -- set a new target speed (km/h):**

```csharp
public static void SetCruiseControl(RCCP_CarController vehicle, bool state, float targetSpeed)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | Target vehicle. |
| `state` | `bool` | `true` = engage, `false` = disengage. |
| `targetSpeed` | `float` | Target speed in km/h. |

```csharp
// Hold 90 km/h
RCCP.SetCruiseControl(playerCar, true, 90f);
```

The proportional gain is `RCCP_Input.cruiseThrottleGain`.

**Related -- Launch control (two-step rev limiter):** an opt-in on `RCCP_Engine` (no facade method). Enable `launchControlEnabled` and tune `launchControlRPM`, `launchControlMaxSpeed`, and `launchControlMinThrottle` in the inspector. It holds engine RPM at the launch target while stationary under throttle for a consistent launch; `RCCP_Exhaust.flameOnLaunchControl` pops backfire while it holds.

---

## Camera

### ChangeCamera

Cycles through the available camera modes on the RCCP camera (TPS, FPS, Top-Down, etc.).

```csharp
public static void ChangeCamera()
```

Takes no parameters. Operates through `RCCP_SceneManager.Instance`.

```csharp
// Bind to a UI button to let the player cycle camera views
public void OnCameraButtonPressed() {
    RCCP.ChangeCamera();
}
```

For more details on available camera modes, see [Camera System](09_camera_system.md).

### Photo Mode (V2.55+)

Freezes the simulation and orbits a temporary camera around the player vehicle for screenshots. `RCCP_PhotoMode` is an auto-created singleton; you normally drive it through the facade below or the `RCCP_UI_PhotoMode` UI component (wire `TogglePhotoMode()` / `Capture()` to uGUI buttons).

```csharp
public static void EnterPhotoMode()
public static void ExitPhotoMode()
public static string CapturePhoto()
```

`EnterPhotoMode` freezes `Time.timeScale`, pauses audio, hides the RCCP camera, and spawns an orbit camera seeded from the current view (mouse orbits, scroll wheel zooms). `ExitPhotoMode` restores timescale, audio, and the RCCP camera. `CapturePhoto` writes a super-size screenshot to `Application.persistentDataPath/Photos` and returns the file path.

```csharp
// Toggle photo mode from a UI button
if (RCCP_PhotoMode.Instance.InPhotoMode)
    RCCP.ExitPhotoMode();
else
    RCCP.EnterPhotoMode();

// Capture (hide your own UI first so it isn't in the shot)
string savedPath = RCCP.CapturePhoto();
```

Interior audio muffle is a related opt-in on `RCCP_Camera`: enable `useInteriorAudioMuffle` to low-pass all audio while the FPS or Wheel (interior) camera modes are active.

---

## Transport

Teleports a vehicle to a new position and rotation. Useful for respawning after going off-track or for checkpoint systems.

### Transport (Player Vehicle)

```csharp
public static void Transport(Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `position` | `Vector3` | World position to move the vehicle to. |
| `rotation` | `Quaternion` | World rotation to apply. |

```csharp
// Respawn the player car at the last checkpoint
RCCP.Transport(checkpointPosition, checkpointRotation);
```

### Transport (Specific Vehicle)

Transports a specific vehicle.

```csharp
public static void Transport(RCCP_CarController vehicle, Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | The vehicle to transport. |
| `position` | `Vector3` | World position to move the vehicle to. |

```csharp
// Transport a specific AI vehicle to a new position
RCCP.Transport(aiCar, spawnPoint.position, spawnPoint.rotation);
```

### Transport (With Velocity Reset)

Transports a specific vehicle and optionally resets its velocity so it does not continue sliding after teleport.

```csharp
public static void Transport(RCCP_CarController vehicle, Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation, bool resetVelocity)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | The vehicle to transport. |
| `position` | `Vector3` | World position to move the vehicle to. |
| `rotation` | `Quaternion` | World rotation to apply. |
| `resetVelocity` | `bool` | If `true`, resets the Rigidbody velocity after transport. |

```csharp
// Transport and stop the car completely
RCCP.Transport(playerCar, respawnPos, respawnRot, true);
```

---

## Behavior

Behavior presets let you change how all vehicles handle at runtime (e.g., switching between "Sim" and "Arcade" modes). Presets are configured in the RCCP Settings asset. See [Settings](04_settings.md) for how to create behavior presets.

### SetBehavior (By Index)

Applies a behavior preset by its index in the `RCCP_Settings.behaviorTypes` array.

```csharp
public static void SetBehavior(int behaviorIndex)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `behaviorIndex` | `int` | Zero-based index into the behavior presets array in RCCP Settings. |

```csharp
// Apply the first behavior preset
RCCP.SetBehavior(0);
```

### SetBehavior (By Name)

Applies a behavior preset by its name. The name comparison is case-insensitive.

```csharp
public static void SetBehavior(string behaviorName)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `behaviorName` | `string` | Name of the behavior preset. Case-insensitive. |

```csharp
// Switch to the "Drift" behavior preset
RCCP.SetBehavior("Drift");
```

If no preset with the given name is found, a warning is logged to the console and no change is made.

### GetBehaviorIndexByName

Returns the index of a behavior preset by its name, or `-1` if not found.

```csharp
public static int GetBehaviorIndexByName(string behaviorName)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `behaviorName` | `string` | Name of the behavior preset. Case-insensitive. |

**Returns:** The zero-based index of the preset, or `-1` if no match is found.

```csharp
int driftIndex = RCCP.GetBehaviorIndexByName("Drift");

if (driftIndex >= 0)
    Debug.Log("Drift preset is at index " + driftIndex);
else
    Debug.Log("Drift preset not found!");
```

### GetBehaviorByName

Returns the full `BehaviorType` object for a preset, or `null` if not found.

```csharp
public static RCCP_Settings.BehaviorType GetBehaviorByName(string behaviorName)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `behaviorName` | `string` | Name of the behavior preset. Case-insensitive. |

**Returns:** The matching `RCCP_Settings.BehaviorType` object, or `null`.

```csharp
RCCP_Settings.BehaviorType simBehavior = RCCP.GetBehaviorByName("Sim");

if (simBehavior != null)
    Debug.Log("Found behavior: " + simBehavior.behaviorName);
```

---

## Mobile Input

### SetMobileController

Changes the active mobile input method at runtime. Use this to let players switch between touch controls, gyroscope, steering wheel UI, or joystick.

```csharp
public static void SetMobileController(RCCP_Settings.MobileController mobileController)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mobileController` | `RCCP_Settings.MobileController` | One of: `TouchScreen`, `Gyro`, `SteeringWheel`, `Joystick`. |

```csharp
// Switch to gyroscope controls
RCCP.SetMobileController(RCCP_Settings.MobileController.Gyro);

// Switch to on-screen joystick
RCCP.SetMobileController(RCCP_Settings.MobileController.Joystick);
```

For more details on mobile controls, see [Mobile](07_mobile.md).

---

## Recording

These methods control the vehicle recording and replay system. The vehicle must have an `RCCP_Recorder` component attached through the OtherAddonsManager. See [Recording and Playback](14_recording_playback.md) for setup instructions.

All recording methods perform null checks on the OtherAddonsManager and Recorder components. If either is missing, the call is silently ignored.

### StartStopRecord

```csharp
public static void StartStopRecord(RCCP_CarController vehicle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | Target vehicle to record. |

```csharp
// Toggle recording with a button press
public void OnRecordButton() {
    RCCP.StartStopRecord(playerCar);
}
```

### StartStopReplay (Last Recording)

| `recordedClip` | `RCCP_Recorder.RecordedClip` | The specific recorded clip to play back. |

```csharp
// Play a specific recorded ghost lap
RCCP.StartStopReplay(ghostCar, savedGhostClip);
```

### StopRecordReplay

Stops any active recording or replay on the vehicle.

```csharp
public static void StopRecordReplay(RCCP_CarController vehicle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicle` | `RCCP_CarController` | Target vehicle to stop recording or replaying. |

```csharp
// Force stop all recording/replay
RCCP.StopRecordReplay(playerCar);
```

```

### CleanSkidmarks (By Index)

Removes a specific set of skidmarks by index.

```csharp
public static void CleanSkidmarks(int index)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `index` | `int` | Index of the skidmark set to clean. |

```csharp
// Clean skidmark set 0 only
RCCP.CleanSkidmarks(0);
```

## Events Reference

`RCCP_Events` is a static class containing C# events you can subscribe to. These events fire automatically when the corresponding actions occur in RCCP. Use them to react to vehicle spawns, collisions, camera changes, and more.

### How to Subscribe and Unsubscribe

Always subscribe in `OnEnable()` and unsubscribe in `OnDisable()` to prevent memory leaks and errors from destroyed objects.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class MyGameManager : MonoBehaviour {

    void OnEnable() {
        // Subscribe to events
        RCCP_Events.OnRCCPSpawned += OnVehicleSpawned;
        RCCP_Events.OnRCCPCollision += OnVehicleCollision;
        RCCP_Events.OnVehicleChanged += OnPlayerVehicleChanged;
    }

    void OnDisable() {
        // Unsubscribe from events
        RCCP_Events.OnRCCPSpawned -= OnVehicleSpawned;
        RCCP_Events.OnRCCPCollision -= OnVehicleCollision;
        RCCP_Events.OnVehicleChanged -= OnPlayerVehicleChanged;
    }

    void OnVehicleSpawned(RCCP_CarController vehicle) {
        Debug.Log("Vehicle spawned: " + vehicle.name);
    }

    void OnVehicleCollision(RCCP_CarController vehicle, Collision collision) {
        Debug.Log(vehicle.name + " collided with " + collision.gameObject.name);
    }

    void OnPlayerVehicleChanged() {
        Debug.Log("Player switched to a different vehicle.");
    }
}
```

### Events Table

| Event | Delegate Signature | When It Fires |
|---|---|---|
| `OnRCCPSpawned` | `onRCCPSpawned(RCCP_CarController rccp)` | A player vehicle spawns or becomes enabled. |
| `OnRCCPDestroyed` | `onRCCPDestroyed(RCCP_CarController rccp)` | A player vehicle is destroyed or disabled. |
| `OnRCCPAISpawned` | `onRCCPAISpawned(RCCP_CarController rccp)` | A vehicle with an AI component spawns or becomes enabled. |
| `OnRCCPAIDestroyed` | `onRCCPAIDestroyed(RCCP_CarController rccp)` | A vehicle with an AI component is destroyed or disabled. |
| `OnRCCPCollision` | `onRCCPCollision(RCCP_CarController rccp, Collision collision)` | Any RCCP vehicle collides with another object. |
| `OnRCCPCameraSpawned` | `onRCCPCameraSpawned(RCCP_Camera cam)` | The RCCP camera is spawned or initialized. |
| `OnRCCPUISpawned` | `onRCCPUISpawned(RCCP_UIManager UI)` | The RCCP UI canvas is spawned or initialized. |
| `OnRCCPUIDestroyed` | `onRCCPUIDestroyed(RCCP_UIManager UI)` | The RCCP UI canvas is destroyed or disabled. |
| `OnRCCPUIInformer` | `onRCCPUIInformer(string text)` | A UI informer message should be displayed to the player. |
| `OnBehaviorChanged` | `onBehaviorChanged()` | The global behavior preset is changed via `RCCP.SetBehavior()`. |
| `OnVehicleChanged` | `onVehicleChanged()` | The registered player vehicle changes (no vehicle reference). |
| `OnVehicleChangedToVehicle` | `onVehicleChangedToVehicle(RCCP_CarController carController)` | The registered player vehicle changes (includes the new vehicle reference). |

### Event Details

**OnRCCPSpawned / OnRCCPDestroyed** -- These fire for player vehicles (vehicles without an AI component). If a vehicle has an AI component attached, `OnRCCPAISpawned` and `OnRCCPAIDestroyed` fire instead.

**OnRCCPCollision** -- Provides both the RCCP vehicle and the Unity `Collision` object, so you can inspect contact points, impulse, and the other collider.

**OnVehicleChanged vs OnVehicleChangedToVehicle** -- Both fire when the player vehicle changes. `OnVehicleChanged` takes no parameters (useful when you just need to refresh UI). `OnVehicleChangedToVehicle` passes the new vehicle reference (useful when you need to read data from the new vehicle).

**OnRCCPUIInformer** -- Subscribe to this event to display informational messages in your own custom UI. RCCP fires this when it wants to show a message to the player (e.g., "Engine Started").

| `ConnectedTrailer` | `RCCP_TrailerController` | The currently attached trailer, or `null` if no trailer is connected. |
| `wheelRPM2Speed` | `float` | Vehicle speed calculated from wheel RPM. |
| `tractionWheelRPM2EngineRPM` | `float` | Engine RPM calculated from traction wheel RPM. |

### GetVehicleBehaviorType (V2.31+)

Returns the behavior preset that is actually active on this vehicle, honoring per-vehicle overrides. **Always use this when reading `BehaviorType` fields per-frame** — `RCCP_Settings.SelectedBehaviorType` only returns the global preset and does not respect `useCustomBehavior`.

```csharp
public RCCP_Settings.BehaviorType GetVehicleBehaviorType()
```

**Returns:** The active `BehaviorType` for this vehicle. If `useCustomBehavior` is `true` and `customBehaviorIndex` is valid, returns that custom preset; otherwise returns the global preset (which may be `null` if the index is invalid or the array is empty — every caller must null-check).

```csharp
// Read the active drift mode for this vehicle (custom OR global)
RCCP_Settings.BehaviorType behavior = playerCar.GetVehicleBehaviorType();

if (behavior != null && behavior.driftMode) {
    Debug.Log("This vehicle is in drift mode.");
}
```

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Spawning a Vehicle and Registering as Player

This example spawns a vehicle from a prefab, registers it as the player vehicle, starts the engine, and enables control.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class VehicleSpawner : MonoBehaviour {

    // Assign your vehicle prefab in the Inspector
    public RCCP_CarController vehiclePrefab;
    public Transform spawnPoint;

    void Start() {

        // Spawn the vehicle at the spawn point
        RCCP_CarController car = RCCP.SpawnRCC(
            vehiclePrefab,
            spawnPoint.position,
            spawnPoint.rotation,
            true,   // register as player vehicle
            true,   // enable player control
            true    // start engine
        );

        Debug.Log("Spawned vehicle: " + car.name);

    }
}
```

### Example 2: Switching Between Multiple Vehicles

This example lets the player cycle through a list of pre-spawned vehicles by pressing a key.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class VehicleSwitcher : MonoBehaviour {

    // Assign your pre-spawned vehicles in the Inspector
    public RCCP_CarController[] vehicles;
    private int currentIndex = 0;

    void Start() {

        // Register the first vehicle as the player vehicle
        if (vehicles.Length > 0) {
            RCCP.RegisterPlayerVehicle(vehicles[0], true, true);
        }

    }

    void Update() {

        // Press V to switch to the next vehicle
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.V) && vehicles.Length > 1) {

            // Disable control on the current vehicle
            RCCP.SetControl(vehicles[currentIndex], false);
            RCCP.SetEngine(vehicles[currentIndex], false);

            // Move to the next vehicle
            currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % vehicles.Length;

            // Register the new vehicle as the player vehicle
            RCCP.RegisterPlayerVehicle(vehicles[currentIndex], true, true);

            Debug.Log("Switched to: " + vehicles[currentIndex].name);

        }

    }
}
```

### Example 3: Reading Vehicle Speed and RPM for a Custom HUD

This example reads real-time data from the player vehicle and displays it using Unity UI.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class CustomHUD : MonoBehaviour {

    public Text speedText;
    public Text rpmText;
    public Text gearText;
    public Slider rpmBar;

    void Update() {

        // Get the active player vehicle from the scene manager
        RCCP_CarController car = RCCP_SceneManager.Instance.activePlayerVehicle;

        // If no player vehicle is registered, hide the HUD
        if (car == null) {
            speedText.text = "---";
            rpmText.text = "---";
            gearText.text = "-";
            return;
        }

        // Display speed (always positive for the speedometer)
        speedText.text = car.absoluteSpeed.ToString("F0") + " km/h";

        // Display engine RPM
        rpmText.text = car.engineRPM.ToString("F0") + " RPM";

        // Display current gear (add 1 for human-readable numbering)
        if (car.NGearNow)
            gearText.text = "N";
        else if (car.reversingNow)
            gearText.text = "R";
        else
            gearText.text = (car.currentGear + 1).ToString();

        // RPM bar normalized between min and max RPM
        if (rpmBar != null) {
            float normalizedRPM = Mathf.InverseLerp(car.minEngineRPM, car.maxEngineRPM, car.engineRPM);
            rpmBar.value = normalizedRPM;
        }

    }
}
```

### Example 4: Listening to Events

This example demonstrates subscribing to multiple RCCP events to build a game manager.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class RaceManager : MonoBehaviour {

    void OnEnable() {
        RCCP_Events.OnRCCPSpawned += HandleVehicleSpawned;
        RCCP_Events.OnRCCPCollision += HandleCollision;
        RCCP_Events.OnBehaviorChanged += HandleBehaviorChanged;
        RCCP_Events.OnVehicleChangedToVehicle += HandleVehicleSwitch;
    }

    void OnDisable() {
        RCCP_Events.OnRCCPSpawned -= HandleVehicleSpawned;
        RCCP_Events.OnRCCPCollision -= HandleCollision;
        RCCP_Events.OnBehaviorChanged -= HandleBehaviorChanged;
        RCCP_Events.OnVehicleChangedToVehicle -= HandleVehicleSwitch;
    }

    void HandleVehicleSpawned(RCCP_CarController vehicle) {
        Debug.Log("New vehicle entered the race: " + vehicle.name);
    }

    void HandleCollision(RCCP_CarController vehicle, Collision collision) {
        // Apply score penalty for wall hits
        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Wall")) {
            Debug.Log(vehicle.name + " hit a wall!");
        }
    }

    void HandleBehaviorChanged() {
        Debug.Log("Driving mode changed.");
    }

    void HandleVehicleSwitch(RCCP_CarController newVehicle) {
        Debug.Log("Player now driving: " + newVehicle.name);
    }
}
```
